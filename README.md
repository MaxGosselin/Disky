# Disky

A treemapper built with pygame which allows you to visualize your disk usage and navigate through files.

----

###CONTROLS:

- double click on a tile in the map to open that tile
- right click on a tile in the map to view it's parent folder.
- when prompted for keyboard input just type there is no cursor to speak of.
- single left clicking on the bottom three labels with '->' attached will cause various events as you would expect.

I hope you enjoy using the program as much as I did writing it!
